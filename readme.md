# Docker Images for CI Pipelines

Useful images to use in workflows.

The content of this repository is made available to the public 
under the MIT license, as others may find our dev / CI setup 
useful or at least educational.

Built artifacts contain a mere aggregation of other open source 
software which is available under separate licenses - see the 
documentation included with a specific piece of software in the 
image for details.

## AWS Lambda Ruby

### CI

#### ghcr.io/university-of-york/faculty-dev-docker-images/ci/aws-lambda-ruby-postgres:2.7

This should be identical to the image used in AWS lambdas. Run your tests in this image where possible.

We are including the [shared lambda layer](https://wiki.york.ac.uk/display/CLOUD/AWS%3A+Shared+Lambda+Layers)
provided by SYS to match the production environment.

#### ghcr.io/university-of-york/faculty-dev-docker-images/ci/aws-lambda-ruby-dev:2.7

This is the base AWS ruby lambda with tools installed that allow us to install and build gems. 

Feel free to add additional tooling to this image as required.

### Local Dev

#### ghcr.io/university-of-york/faculty-dev-docker-images/local-dev/aws-lambda-ruby-dev:2.7

This is the dev CI image tweaked for local development work (with docker-compose).

It will install gems into `/bundler`, which should be a volume shared with the `app` container, so this image can
install the gems, and the app can use them (see 
[sinatra-base](https://github.com/university-of-york/faculty-dev-sinatra-base/blob/main/docker-compose.yml))
for an example).

#### ghcr.io/university-of-york/faculty-dev-docker-images/local-dev/aws-lambda-ruby-postgres:2.7

This is the postgres CI image tweaked for local development work.

* Add `rerun` to reload the app when code changes are detected.
* Set up bundler to use `/bundler` (see `aws-lambda-ruby-builder` above)
* Open port 9292 and set the default command to run `rerun`

Rerun is installed separately and the gem copied into the local image to avoid 'polluting' the main app image
with build tools.

##### Limitations

We are still skipping the lambda handler here; we would need to set up a mock Load Balancer to take a request 
(e.g. http://localhost) and convert it to a lambda event. This could be looked at in the future to *really* match
the production environment, but at the time of writing, there doesn't seem to be an easy way to mock the Load Balancer.
